  1. mkdir build
  2. cd build
  3. cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" ..
  4. devenv libspirit.sln /project ALL_BUILD /build Release

BUILD ON UNIX WITH AUTOTOOLS AND GCC
  Follow these steps:
  
  1. mkdir build
  2. cd build
  3. cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ./../
  4. make
  
WHAT CHANGES HAPPENED TO CURL AND YAJL?
  There a nearly no changes but we need to add the compiler flag -fPIC to
  compile on Unix x64 systems. The following modifications are done:
  
      yajl/src/CMakeLists.txt around line 28:
      
          ADD_DEFINITIONS(-DYAJL_BUILD -fPIC)  #HACK added -fPIC
          
      curl/lib/CMakeLists.txt around line 100:
      
          if(WIN32)
            add_definitions( -D_USRDLL )
          else() #HACK
            add_definitions ( -fPIC ) #HACK
          endif()
